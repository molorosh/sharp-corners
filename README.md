# Release Notes
## 2023-Sep-29

# Development Notes
## initial project setup
the first thing is to create the project by running 

  ng new

* for google analytics/anon feedback I selected: "No"
* name for workspace and initial project: "web-app"
* add angular routing: "Yes"
* pick a styling solution: CSS, SCSS, Sass, LESS: "Sass"

then the process runs ... (chug, chug, chug)

## the basics
obviously you can start the project locally with:

`ng serve`

also you can specify the port with:

`ng serve --port 8080`

you can build the project for deployment with

`ng build`

which packages your webapp to the `/dist/` folder
